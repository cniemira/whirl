## A web interface to libcurl

This is an insanely stupid piece of code. It tries to be a sort of browser-within-a-browser. All things you could do fairly easily with a good set of plugins (or just the developer tools in any modern browser). But this was supposed to be "easier" somehow. Fortunately, I got distracted not long after I started, and the original requestor lost interest.

It comes with no warranty and should be considered public domain at this point.
